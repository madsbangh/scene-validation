# Extensible scene validator for Unity3D

This editor extension adds a tool that validates your scenes.

![Validator UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madsbangh/scene-validation/readme/img/UI.png)

Each scene in the project can be accompanied by a Validator script. The tool finds the appropriate script based on whether the current scene matches the scene path defined in an attribute.

## This project is early in development

I would love any kind of help making this tool more robust, helpful or better in any other way. Feel free to post issues or even make pull requests :)
